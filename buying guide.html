        <h2>What Do You Need?</h2>
        <p>Whether you’re building for home office or gaming, the components you need are going to be generally the same. For the purposes of this guide you're going to see a lot of abbreviations, so let this section act as your glossary.</p>
        <h4>Almost every computer needs, at the very least, the following components:</h4>
        <ul>
            
            <li>Motherboard</li>
            <li>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</li>
            <li>Graphic Card</li>
            <li>Memory (RAM)</li>
            <li>Storage (Typically a Solid State Drive or SSD)</li>
            <li>Power Supply (PSU)</li>
            
        </ul>
   
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Motherboard</h1>
        <img src="motherboard.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Hardware</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Gigabyte B650 Gaming X AX (AM5 Socket): This motherboard has a few extra ports (including Thunderbolt 3) you'll appreciate if you're building a mid to high-end gaming PC on an AMD processor.</li>
            <li>Asus Prime B760-Plus D4 (LGA 1700 Socket): This Asus board is great for a midrange gaming PC, and for the price it has quite a few (four) M.2 Ports.</li>
            <li>Gigabyte A620M Gaming X (AM5 Socket) Micro-ATX: This one is a Micro-ATX-sized motherboard, so it's for smaller builds, but it's a great pick if you're working on an adorable little mini gaming rig.</li>
        </ol>

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>processor</h1>
        <img src="processor.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Hardware</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Intel Core i7-12700K 8-Core 3.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket): An Intel i7 will see you through most heavy workday tasks and 4K gaming.</li>
            <li>AMD Ryzen 9 7950X 16-core 5.7 GHz (AM5 Socket): AMD's 16-core behemoth is a killer CPU for high-end 4K or 144-Hz gaming, but it has some special requirements. It gets so hot there's no way you should put it into a PC without a liquid cooler like the Asus ROG Strix LC Liquid Cooler.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Graphics Card (GPU)</h1>
        <img src="gpu.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Nvidia GeForce Hardware</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Asus ROG Strix RTX 3060: Nvidia’s RTX 3060 is a killer 1080p and 1440p gaming graphics card.</li>
            <li>Zotac GeForce RTX 3080: This is still one of the top-performing graphics cards, even if you're running games at 4K with ray-tracing on. Add that it's under $1,000, and it's very appealing.</li>
            <li>MSI GeForce RTX 2060: If you're looking to get into medium-end gaming, this card strikes a good balance between power and price. Also a great pick for an office computer that will do some video editing or some light gaming.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Memory (RAM)</h1>
        <img src="memory.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Hardware</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>G.Skill Ripjaws V Series 32-GB 288-Pin RAM: With this much RAM, you should be pretty well set for everyday tasks and gaming.</li>
            <li>Corsair Dominator Platinum 64-GB 288-Pin RAM: If you need extra heft for content creation or high-end gaming, consider stepping up to 64 GB of RAM.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Storage</h1>
        <img src="storage.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Hardware</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Corsair MP600 M.2 SSD: Corsair's MP600 drive comes with a built-in heat sink to keep temperatures down while it transfers your data at blazing speeds. It features a 4,950 MB/s read speed and 4,250 MB/s write speed.</li>
            <li>WD Blue 1-TB Internal SSD: It's reasonably quick, with plenty of storage space, but this Western Digital model is better for a secondary storage drive—not the one you run games or your operating system off of.</li>

        </ol>
        
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Power Supply (PSU)</h1>
        <img src="powersupply.webp">
        <h4>Suggested Hardware</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>EVGA 1000GT: An upgrade pick looks something like the EVGA 1000T. Still fully modular, this power supply offers a slightly higher wattage.</li>
            <li>Corsair RM1000X 1000-Watt Power Supply: For PCs with multiple graphics cards or a whole lot of storage, Corsair's 1,000-watt PSU is a good pick.</li>
        </ol>
